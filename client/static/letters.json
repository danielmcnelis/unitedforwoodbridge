    "content": "Like many others, I am dismayed by the precipitous action of our Board of Selectmen (BOS) in ending, without notice, its stated intention to “pause” consideration of selling the Country Club of Woodbridge Property.\n\nAs reported in this publication on December 17, 2021, First Selectman Heller recently stated, “I believe it’s in the best interest of the town to hold off…with any proposal at this time,” she said.  She hopes that the right person will assist the Board of Selectmen to develop a comprehensive plan that residents can support.  “This is a proactive way for us to determine the future for our town.”\n\nA few short weeks later, the promised “pause” was reversed without explanation, without the hiring of the “right person,” without the development of a comprehensive plan, without consideration by the Housing Opportunity Study Committee (which, presumably, was created to review proposals such as this), without referral to the 2030 Task Force (charged with brainstorming ways to diversify the Town’s grand list), and without inclusion in the recently begun Strategic Planning process.\n\nBy unhappy coincidence, the BOS decision to discard its prior pledges came immediately after it again became necessary to restrict public participation due to COVID resurgence.  It would be unfortunate if the BOS, in its apparent haste to make a deal, would push forward without the analysis it previously identified as necessary at a time when the public’s ability to hear and be heard on the largest development in the Town’s history is constrained by COVID.\n\nThis is to request that the BOS resume the pause and use the time to:\n\nFulfill its pledge to obtain the advice of the “right person” or persons to guide us through these important issues. There seems to be considerable disagreement as to the revenues (e.g. taxes) and expenses (e.g. education, improvements and maintenance) associated with Arbor Haven and other developments.  This advisor should develop a “build-out analysis” reflecting the recent changes to the zoning regulations that now allow major residential development with unprecedented density in every neighborhood.\n\nRefer the matter to the 2021 Housing Committee. Otherwise, why have it?\n\nFully consider other proposals for use of the property including the offer from the Woodbridge Land Trust and the Woodbridge Park Association to purchase a conservation restriction.\n\nThe BOS was wise in deferring consideration of the Arbor Haven proposal pending a reasoned evaluation of potential development of that and other properties in Town.  One wishes that they would stand by that pledge."

    "content": "We were dismayed to read a recent letter suggesting that the Woodbridge Land Trust and the Woodbridge Park Association are attempting to thwart diverse housing options in Woodbridge by proposing to protect the Roger Sherman Farm located on the Country Club of Woodbridge property.  The goal of our organizations is to protect a historic, ecologically and environmentally significant parcel of open space land, a precious, finite natural resource.  We do not believe that protecting open space and promoting diverse housing are mutually exclusive.  Our town can, and should, do both.\n\nThe State of Connecticut recognizes the importance of both of these goals, and does not place them in conflict with one another.  The State actively encourages towns and non-profit land trusts to protect open space, recreational, and agricultural lands by funding this protection with many millions of dollars every year through grants awarded by the Department of Agriculture (DOAG) and the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP).\n\nWe in Woodbridge are fortunate to have a few remaining large open space land parcels.  Many towns, especially those so close to a city, don’t have the same ability to preserve open space.  Providing housing opportunities is about more than building homes, it is building them in communities where people want to live.  Let’s not squander the opportunity to preserve this priceless vanishing asset for the benefit of all members of our community – present and future.\n\n"

Our two organizations have submitted a formal offer to purchase a grant of conservation restriction on this property, one of the largest, most magnificent parcels of open space land remaining in our town.\n\nThe First Selectman has raised concerns about our plan because she believes it will “tie up” the land.  However, we believe that protecting open space does not tie up land, rather it opens up the land to uses that benefit the entire community.\n\nIn 10, 20, 50, 100 years, do you think anyone will be at all interested in how much it cost to protect this precious natural resource?  The cost is irrelevant – the land is priceless!\n\nWoodbridge residents have an opportunity to do something profound:  protect – forever – a historic farm and beautiful open space land in our town.  In the coming weeks and months, the WLT and WPA plan to provide our neighbors with facts to show that – both short and long term – the only truly viable proposal for the Roger Sherman Farm is our proposal.\n\nEconomically, ecologically, environmentally, historically, psychologically, aesthetically– this property will benefit the residents of Woodbridge far more as protected open space than any of the housing developments proposed over the last twelve years.\n\nStay tuned…"

    "content": "Hillel Auerbach’s recent letter questions my calculations of the cost of adding hundreds of residents to our town if the Arbor Haven proposal goes forward.  He suggests that we should use marginal cost to estimate school expenses.  For two reasons, marginal cost simply does not apply in this case.\n\nThe Amity school system is a regional system, serving three towns.  The Amity school board bills each town on a per student basis – therefore, for each additional student from Woodbridge, the cost to Woodbridge taxpayers increases by $20,000 per year.  There is no such thing as marginal cost in this situation.\n\nThe concept of marginal cost is also inapplicable at Beecher Road school, because we are currently at the enrollment limit – according to the superintendent’s recent statement, we are using “every nook and cranny” in the school building.  Adding the number of students who would result from a large housing development would tip the enrollment over the school building’s physical capacity, necessitating a large infrastructure project.  Building an addition onto the school would cost how much – $30 million?  $40 million?  $50 million?  Certainly, much more than the taxes that could be collected on the homes in question.\n\nIt is a well-known and broadly accepted fact that residential development is profitable only for developers; it has never been, and will never be, financially beneficial for towns.  Indeed, the Highstead Foundation of Redding, CT recently published a paper summarizing 39 separate studies conducted across New England showing how open space land provides financial benefit to towns and residential development creates a financial drain.  Open space benefits towns in many ways – in addition to costing towns much less than residential land, open space mitigates the effects of climate change, raises property values for current homeowners, and enhances quality of life for everyone.  Let’s maintain our quality of life here in Woodbridge by thinking beyond a short-term cash grab and permanently protecting this land.  Future generations will thank us."

    "content": "Cathy Wick asserts the Arbor Haven Proposal will produce a large financial loss for the town.  The Proposal – and Ms Wick – persist in using average costs instead of marginal costs.  That is, what is the cost of adding one more residence and family?\n\nTo determine this, we should look at the families that have moved into Woodbridge in recent years – say, five years – and see how many school-age children they had and have.  For the same period, we can determine how many children attended Woodbridge schools, and what was the percentage of capacity use of our schools.  With this information, we can begin to calculate the costs of an additional 153 students – or however many additional students we may reasonably expect over time.  Similarly, we can estimate the marginal cost of police, library, roads, and general overhead to estimate “the additional cost of adding adult residents to the town” in Ms. Wick words.\n\nIf we “sharpen up our pencils” I am reasonably sure that the deficit projected by Ms. Wick is illusory.  The sale of the land will enable the town to pay off the remaining debt associated with its purchase and have a substantial sum – perhaps $5.5 million – left over to use for town capital projects.  If the Board of Selectmen is interested in this Project, they should prepare the necessary calculations and present them to the voters, with a complete explanation of the assumptions underlying them.\n\nIt was a bad deal for the town when the WCC property was acquired, a bad deal when the town leased the property to a golf club operator, and a worse deal when the town tried to operate a golf course.  It is past time to undo these “bad deals” and put the property to productive use for the benefit of the taxpayers of the town!"

Let’s get the facts before we decide what to believe about the best future for the Country Club of Woodbridge property.\n\nA couple of years ago, as a member of the Board of Selectmen, I shared a paper with my board colleagues written by Thomas DiNapoli, the New York State Comptroller.  Entitled “Economic Benefits of Open Space Preservation,” this paper systematically explains, from the point of view of a finance expert, why open space is more financially beneficial to municipalities than residential development.\n\nMore recently, the Highstead Foundation of Redding, CT., published “The Economic Case for Conservation.”  Among many facts presented in this paper is a summary of 39 separate studies conducted across New England proving, again and again, that open space land provides financial benefit to towns and residential development creates a financial drain on towns.\n\nTime and again, developers have come to Woodbridge claiming that housing at the CCW will be a financial boon for our town – this is equivalent to claiming that the earth is flat, that climate change is a hoax, and that JFK lives on.  Surprisingly, some of the Selectmen seem to believe these “alternative” facts.\n\nPreserving the CCW land as open space is a financially responsible decision based on facts.  Do facts matter? They must."

    "date": "12/16/21",
    "url": "https://woodbridgetownnews.com/letter-ccw-what-are-our-selectmen-doing-once-again/",
    "content": "In the Woodbridge Town News edition of November 16, 2018 appeared a letter by me titled “Country Club of Woodbridge – What Are Our Selectmen Doing?”  Most all of what I wrote about at that time is still true today with the misguided potential supported by the First Selectman, the town attorney and other Selectmen to develop the priceless open space at the Country Club of Woodbridge.  I have also written about this being a recurring nightmare.\n\nAt the time, in the “Woodbridge News and Events” for November 2018 under November Planning and Updates, First Selectman Beth Heller wrote about the Former Country Club Property.  She advised then that the Selectmen had received a new proposal for the former Country Club of Woodbridge (CCW) from the developer of Fieldstone Village of Orange.  Now it is a new, unsolicited proposal from new developers interested in building approximately 145 homes on the property being touted by our First Selectman.  If this were to go through it will create enormous challenges for our schools and town services in the years to come.\n\nWhat follows is exactly what I wrote three years ago:\n\n“Simply stated, we need leadership from our town leaders.  It appears the Selectmen are awaiting anyone to send a proposal in to them as to what to do with the former CCW property.  This is not leadership; this is management by incoming letter.\n\n“I am on record in a previous Letter to the Editor, apparently ignored by our Selectmen, for the preservation of the open space of this very historically significant “crown jewel” property.  Any zoning change for this property will have enormous follow-on consequences for other properties in town and bring in housing much more clustered than our present 1½ acre zoning that our town leaders have had the vision to include in our residential zoning regulations for many years.  It is due to this that Woodbridge, although significantly developed, has retained its unique character.\n\n“I informed townspeople about the history of the property deeds for the former CCW and the history of this property.  One-time owners included Captain John Beecher and Patriot & Statesman Roger Sherman.  The Roger Sherman connection to the CCW property is that he owned that property as Clover Hill Farm during the time he served as mayor of New Haven.\n\n“If you do not know who Roger Sherman was, or if you are not aware of the historical significance, I suggest you do your own assessment.  It is easy, start with:  http://www.townhistory.org/clover-hill-farm/.  USA Founding Father Roger Sherman lived from 1721 to 1793 and is the only person to have signed all papers of independence of the United States:  the Continental Association, the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution.  He was an influential member of the Constitutional Convention and a true statesman.  In 1784, he was the first mayor of New Haven.\n\n“The former CCW property owner prior to Roger Sherman was Captain John Beecher, and his family’s presence on this property prior to the incorporation of the Town of Woodbridge takes us back as far as the founding of New Haven and the original Beecher family in America.  (Think Beecher Road).  If you don’t know of Captain John Beecher, he was an ancestor of Lyman Beecher and his daughter Harriet Beecher Stowe — and her siblings.  The former CCW property was also owned at one time by James Hillhouse; there is so much more about these families in books and references on Woodbridge history.\n\nWe have a very unique opportunity to save this property as was envisioned when the town purchased it and decisions made now will have for-ever consequences.  Please recognize the history of this property, I argue it is the most historically significant location in our town.”\n\nI continue to strongly recommend maintaining the open space of the former golf course, when developed, it will be gone for the public good and historical purposes forever.  An RFP process should be constructed that invites proposals for:\n\nRenovation/replacement of the country club catering/banquet facility for operation as a for-profit property tax-paying venture;\n\nRenovation/replacement of the pool for townspeople summer use, there is no other outdoor town owned pool;\n\nCreate an open space/conservation easement or farmland preservation grant to guarantee operation of the former golf course as a farm; we need more local farms; or just provide for public access and outdoor enjoyment; and\n\nAlternatively consider working with our legislators to create a state park for this parcel to teach our children about history!\n\nAs we know, town leaders have had issues managing the golf course facility under contract to an operating firm.  Town leaders proved that they were unable to manage the golf course either by itself or under contract to a provider.  We must preserve this critical parcel of open space; it is one of the most important opportunities we have at this time to leave a legacy to generations of townspeople to come."

    "content": "In its public presentation on September 29th, potential County Club developer Arbor Haven promised that all new roads would be privately owned and maintained by a homeowners’ association.  However, past experience demonstrates that a homeowners’ association can easily abandon its road responsibilities, cede ownership of the road to the town, and thereby pass the burdensome cost of road maintenance, including snowplowing, onto the town’s taxpayers.  Since this has happened in Woodbridge before, it should be expected to happen again.\n\nArbor Haven also claimed that its new roads would be constructed of permeable material in order to minimize the stormwater runoff impacts of development.  But there is a reason why roads and driveways are generally paved – permeable alternatives readily develop ruts and require frequent attention.  Any new homeowner within an approved Country Club development is likely to want asphalt.\n\nWoodbridge taxpayers should be wary of both promises, as well as any other gimmicks designed to make this development look good."

    "url": "https://woodbridgetownnews.com/letter-do-the-math-arbor-haven-proposal-will-produce-large-financial-loss-for-the-town/",
    "content": "Real estate developer Arbor Haven has proposed to purchase 100 acres of the former Country Club of Woodbridge property from the town to build a massive 145-unit housing development.  Arbor Haven’s sales pitch to the town rests on its claim that the town will realize a financial profit from the yearly tax revenue generated by the new homes.\n\nA cursory examination of the numbers reveals that Arbor Haven is presenting faulty math:  it turns out that the Arbor Haven proposal will actually produce a LARGE NET LOSS for the town.\n\nThe first version of the proposal, presented to the selectmen in August, based its income calculations on inaccurate estimates of school cost.  Arbor Haven projected that its development would add an additional 153 students to Woodbridge schools at a cost of $12,000 per student per year.  Of course, we all know that Woodbridge spends closer to $20,000 per student per year (a figure confirmed by the town’s finance director at the 9/8/21 selectmen’s meeting).\n\nWhen Arbor Haven was informed of the actual school expense, it came back with a revised proposal for the September 29th information session.  The per-student annual cost was revised upward to a more realistic $17,500, but oddly, the number of students had magically shrunk by half.  Presto change-o!  This maneuver would be insulting if it wasn’t so comically transparent – how stupid does Arbor Haven think we are?  The original student estimate combined with the real cost per student yields a whopping annual expense to the town of $2,677,500.\n\nIn addition to vastly undercounting the number of schoolchildren the development would produce, Arbor Haven neglected to account for the additional cost of adding adult residents to the town.  The standard multiplier used to calculate these costs (used by the town’s finance director to evaluate prior development proposals) is $2,000 per resident per year.  This covers costs like police, fire, library, roads, and general overhead.  So, if this development adds about 300 new adult residents to the town, they will create $600,000 per year in new expenses bringing the total expense of the development to $3,277,500 per year.  Since the projected tax revenue is $2,733,000 the town ends up with more than a half-million-dollar deficit every year.\n\nResidential growth creates profits for developers – it has never been, and will never be, financially beneficial to any town.  Instead of chasing this fool’s gold, the First Selectman should put her energies into growing our business sector, bringing in the type of taxpayers who actually create a net gain on the bottom line."

    "content": "Proponents of the Arbor Haven plan justify their support based upon the expected receipt by the town of tax revenues (Town Tax Revenues) that will substantially exceed all costs that may be incurred by the town as a result of the development (Town Costs).  There are at least two fundamental flaws in their reasoning.\n\nFirst, it is likely that the Town Costs projected by the developer upon the build-out of the planned development are substantially understated; indeed, it is very possible that the actual Town Costs will exceed not only the developer’s Town Costs projections, thus reducing the claimed Town Tax Revenues benefits, but would actually exceed the developer’s projected Town Tax Revenues, so that the development would result in net losses to the town.\n\nEven more troubling than any misstatement of the Town Costs is the unwillingness of the developer to stand behind his Town Tax Revenue projections.  When asked directly what portion of those claimed Town Tax Revenues he would guarantee that the town would receive, he responded “None whatsoever!”  So, the town may be in the position of selling the extraordinary asset that is its largest tract of undeveloped property, and receiving not a penny of Town Tax Revenues in exchange.\n\nThe good citizens of Woodbridge cannot be so clueless as to enter into such a one-sided and unprofitable deal that would guarantee that the unique WCC property would be lost forever without any certainty of the receipt of any Town Tax Revenues in exchange – much less the amount of Town Tax Revenues projected by the developer!"
