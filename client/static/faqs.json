      "question": "The First Selectman says the State has \"mandated\" that every town must have 10% affordable housing. Is that true?",
      "answer": "No! The affordable housing appeals law (Connecticut General Statute § 8-30g) created a threshold of 10%. If a town has less than 10% affordable housing, then the law applies. Towns with more than 10% legally affordable housing earn an exemption from the law. Since Woodbridge has less than 10% legally affordable housing, it has not earned an exemption, and thus is subject to the law. There is no legal mandate."
    },
    {
      "question": "So, is Woodbridge in violation of the affordable housing law?",
      "answer": "No! A town with less than 10% affordable housing is not breaking any law, it just has a different standard of proof in court if it is sued after denying a developer's affordable housing application. The town must show that the proposed development was denied for significant public health, public safety, or public welfare reasons. The only legal requirement regarding affordable housing that Woodbridge is currently subject to is that it must create a housing plan on paper by June 2022. That process is nearing completion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are towns always sued if they deny affordable housing, and do they always lose these cases?",
      "answer": "No! Woodbridge's Town Plan & Zoning Commission denied the affordable housing application for 2 Orchard Road last year, and was not sued, even though the apparent purpose of that application was not to build the proposed affordable housing but to create a \"test case\" that Yale law students could argue in court as a class project. Recently, the towns of Fairfield and Easton have both won court cases in which their denials of affordable housing developments were upheld."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Woodbridge an outlier in having relatively little legally affordable housing?",
      "answer": "No! According to the CT Department of Housing's 2021 Affordable Housing Appeals List, only 31 out of 169 towns have surpassed the state's threshold of 10% affordable housing. Woodbridge has 1.18%, Bethany has 0.64%, and Orange has 1.35%."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Woodbridge housing stock uniformly expensive?",
      "answer": "No! Woodbridge actually has diverse housing stock. According to the Town Tax Assessor's 2021 database, there are more than 300 homes in Woodbridge appraised at $250,000 or less. These \"naturally\" affordable homes are in every neighborhood. They are not considered \"legally\" affordable because they are not legally restricted or otherwise enrolled in a government program, and thus do not count toward the Town's official tally."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the State require towns to build affordable housing themselves or to sell public land for it?",
      "answer": "No! The First Selectman seems to believe that the Town is under an urgent legal obligation to provide affordable housing, but she is mistaken. No law requires any town to build or devote public land to housing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Has Woodbridge done anything to encourage affordable housing?",
      "answer": "Yes! Last year, in the wake of the affordable housing application for 2 Orchard Road, the Town Plan & Zoning Commission made the following major changes to the Town's zoning regulations. Dominic Thomas, the Chair of the Housing Opportunity Study Committee, praised these changes to zoning, saying they make Woodbridge \"a leader\" in the state.\n\n• Accessory Dwelling Units are permitted \"by right\" in every zone\n• Duplexes are permitted \"by right\" everywhere except in the public water supply watershed, which safeguards drinking water for New Haven area customers\n• Duplexes are permitted in the watershed with TPZ commission review\n• Multifamily housing of up to 15 units per acre is permitted in every zone if the parcel has public sewer and water"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there places in Town other than on public open space where affordable housing could be built?",
      "answer": "Yes! The Housing Opportunity Study Committee has compiled a list of potential locations in town for affordable housing. In addition, the zoning changes summarized above will encourage more diverse housing to be built town wide."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is public open space a good place for dense housing of any kind?",
      "answer": "No! All the experts, including the Town's housing consultant David Fink, agree that walkable neighborhoods, with easy access to daily shopping needs and to public transportation, are the best places for dense housing of all kinds, including age restricted housing and affordable housing. In particular, it is important for affordable housing to be walkable to shopping and on public transportation lines, since those who qualify for affordable housing often do not own and cannot afford vehicles."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do we have to choose between diversifying our housing and preserving our open space?",
      "answer": "No! The State has two goals that it is asking towns to pursue simultaneously: increasing housing opportunity AND preserving open space. These two goals are NOT mutually exclusive. In Woodbridge, we have the rare ability to have our cake and eat it too – we have already changed our zoning regulations to allow more housing opportunity, AND we can protect our irreplaceable natural resources, such as the land at the former Country Club of Woodbridge."
